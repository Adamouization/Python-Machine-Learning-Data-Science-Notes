# Python - Machine Learning & Data Science Notes

Python code and notes in the form of Jupyter Notebooks useful for general Machine Learning and Data Science projects. 

Covers the following topics:

* [X] Pandas operations
* [X] Data Cleaning in Pandas
* [X] Data Visualisation in Matplotlib and Seaborn
* [ ] Scikit-Learn models

You download/read the compiled notebooks in HTML format in the [`html_notebooks`](https://github.com/Adamouization/Python-Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Notes/tree/master/html_notebooks) directory.

## Usage

Download this repository, create a virtual environment and activate it:

```
virtualenv ~/Environments/Python-Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Notes
source Python-Machine-Learning-Data-Science-Notes/bin/activate
```

Once you have the virtualenv activated and set up, cd into the project directory and install the requirements needed to run the notebooks:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Open Jupyter and access/run the notebooks individually:

```
jupyter lab
```
